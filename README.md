# brightmixer
A very simple and poorly written python script to use xrandr to adjust screen brightness. The styling of the program is stolen from pulsemixer. It should work with multiple screens, and has in my little testing. 

sb-brightmixer is for dwmblocks statusbar, the file needs to be edited to adjust for wherever your script is located.
